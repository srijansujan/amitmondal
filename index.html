<p align="justify"> Amit comes from the village of Gournagar in the Mohammad Bazar area of Birbhum district. His father is a small farmer with a meagre income barely enough to sustain a family of five. Due to their poor economic condition Amit had to stay at his uncle’s place to continue his studies. In spite of all adversities, he scored 85% in his Higher Secondary Examinations and subsequently joined Suri Vidyasagar College in 2016 to study  Chemistry. Srijan Sujan will assist him in his journey. </p>
